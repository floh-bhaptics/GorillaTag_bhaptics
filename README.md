# GorillaTag_bhaptics
Basic bhaptics support for Gorilla Tag

## Installation

The newest version runs on BepInEx, since that has been established as the most common mod loader for Gorilla Tag. So:

1. Get the MonkeModManager from [here](https://github.com/BzzzThe18th/MonkeModManager) and use it to install BepInEx (by default, just click Install/Update).
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/GorillaTag_bhaptics/releases/latest/download/GorillaTag_bhaptics.zip) of the mod and unzip the contents into the "BepInEx\plugins\" directory in your game folder.
3. Start the game. There should be a heartbeat on startup to show you that the mod is working.

## Featured effects

Right now, only movement in the hands, arms and shoulder is supported, and getting tagged or changing the color or status (frozen, infected, "it") of your gorilla.
